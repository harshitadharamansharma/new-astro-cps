# CPS-DLS #4 – Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Image Analysis – CyPSi Lab – IIC
##### About the Speaker

Erik Meijering is a Professor of Biomedical Image Computing in the School of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia. He received his MSc degree in Electrical Engineering from Delft University of Technology (1996) and his PhD degree in Medical Image Analysis from Utrecht University (2000), both in the Netherlands. Before moving to UNSW (in 2019), he was a Postdoctoral Fellow (2000-2002) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, and an Assistant Professor (2002-2008) and later Associate Professor (2008-2019) at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands.

Prof. Meijering is an IEEE Fellow (2019) and has served as a Technical Committee Member, Bio Imaging and Signal Processing (BISP) (2005-2010); Chair, BISP TC (2018-2019), the IEEE EMBS Technical Committee on Biomedical Imaging and Image Processing (BIIP, since 2007), the cross-Society IEEE Life Sciences Technical Community (LSTC, 2018-2020), and the IEEE SPS Technical Directions Board (2018-2019). He is an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (since 2004), Biological Imaging (since 2020), International Journal on Biomedical Imaging (2006-2009), and the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (2008-2011). He was Guest Editor for special issues of the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine (on Quantitative Bioimaging: Signal Processing in Light Microscopy (January 2015), and on Deep Learning in Biological Image and Signal Processing (March 2022)) and the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (on Molecular and Cellular Bioimaging (September 2005)).

Prof. Meijering was Technical Program Chair, IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) (2006, 2010, 2018); Steering Committee Chair, ISBI (2005-2008, 2018-2020); Workshop Chair, International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) (2020), and co-organized several conferences: the BioImage Informatics Conference (BII) (2014, 2017) and the Workshop on BioImage Computing (BIC) (since 2016). He also served/serves on a variety of other international conference, advisory, and review boards.

Prof. Meijering’s multidisciplinary research interests are in computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning, for quantitative biomedical image analysis.
