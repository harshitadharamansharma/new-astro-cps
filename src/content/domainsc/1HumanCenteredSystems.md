# Human Centered Systems – CyPSi Lab – IIC
Technology-driven engineering systems have a significant presence in almost all spheres of life today. They are evolving at a very fast pace in terms of AI, computational capacities and their scope of use with each passing year.

While they offer numerous benefits to society on one hand, there is an intellectual challenge to envision, design and research human-centered Systems for the future to integrate CPS with various social units – organizations, communities and distinctive social processes and practices.

*Human Cyber Physical Systems (HCPS) are emerging to identify principles for the human-centered design of future CPS and to break away the limitations of Cyber Physical. These systems enable the development of social systems by placing humans inside the control loop.*
